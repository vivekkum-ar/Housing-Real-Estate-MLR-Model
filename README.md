# Housing-Real-Estate-MLR-Model
A real estate firm with a dataset comprising property values in the Delhi area. It intends to use the data to optimise property selling prices based on significant characteristics such as space, bedrooms, parking, and so on. Essentially, the organisation aims to â€” - Identify the characteristics influencing housing pricing, such as area, number of rooms, bathrooms, and so on. - To develop a linear model that quantitatively correlates property prices with characteristics such as room count, area, number of bathrooms, and so on. - To determine the model's accuracy, i.e. how well these variables predict home prices.
